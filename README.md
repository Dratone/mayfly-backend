### What is mayfly?

Mayfly is a webapplication designed to securely send passwords to customers.
Passwords are only retrievable once with the correct link. After trying it once, the password becomes inaccessible.

Passwords are not stored unencrypted and can only be decrypted with the information provided in a generated link.
